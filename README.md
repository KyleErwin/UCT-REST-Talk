# UCT Restful APIs Talk
Source code, slides and postman collections for a virtual presentation on REST for the DevSoc students at UCT

---

Here are the example APIs we looked at
- [dog-api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/)
- [rick-and-morty-api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

Those were obtain from [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), where many more intresting open APIs can be found.

Lastly, [crudcrud](https://crudcrud.com/) was used to demo the Java rest client. When running the application, you may need to update the base URL as they only last 24 hours.
